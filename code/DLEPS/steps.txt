- Collect prostate cancer specific drugs - sort by popularity - Done!!!
- Calculate fingerprints - Pipeline is ready!!
- Take the training set drugs, calculate fingerprints for them as well (425 drugs)
    - Extract the SMILES for 425 drugs, load onto maple - Done!!!
- Finaly, calculate the tanimoto similarity between the drugs - Done!!!
- Additionally, calculate the tanimoto similarity between each reference drugs - Done!!!
- Merge the features to the existing model:
    1) Pass the 425x18x1 dataset to an DNN, create 56 features - merge the 18 features to the existing (56,56) space
    2) Pass the 3072 fingerprints to DNN, convert to 56 features - then merge with (56,56) space
    3) Pass the 18x3072 features to VAE - convert to 56 features - then merge with (56,56) space
- Update - IC50 dataset downloaded from GDSC can be used to extract drugs targeted against PRAD (prostate cancer cell line) and use them as reference drugs - This will increase the similarity matrix size. The steps are as follows:
    1) Filter out drugs targeted against PRAD - Done!!!
    3) Filter out drugs based on effective max_conc - < 10uM in concentration - Done!!!
    2) Check the availability of SMILES of those drugs in PubChem - 207 drugs found - Done!!!
    4) Finally prepare the ssp - Done!!!
        a) Reference drugs fingerprints dataset shape - (207, 3072)
        b) Training drugs fingerprints dataset shape - (475, 3072)
        c) Combining these two, the shape of the ssp vector dataset would be - (475, 207, 3072) - Done!!!
    5) Create a vae model framework and train it with training drugs information - In progress...
        a) Adopt VAE from fast.ai - To be started...
        b) Create the training dataset - In progress...
            i) Start with a subset of compounds from Pubchem database (source: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/), calculate fingerprints, calculate similarity with reference drugs - In Progress
            ii) Next, train the model with a larger set from that dataset
    6) Pass the prepared dataset through the pre-trained model:
        a) Learn the (56, ) shape representation as latent phase representation
        b) Merge the representation to the existing model - and get the prediction PCC
