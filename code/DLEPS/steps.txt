- Finaly, calculate the tanimoto similarity between the drugs - Done!!!
- Additionally, calculate the tanimoto similarity between each reference drugs
- Merge the features to the existing model:
    1) Merge the 18 features to the existing (56,56) space
    2) Pass the 3072 fingerprints to DNN, convert to 56 features - then merge with (56,56) space
    3) Pass the 18x3072 features to VAE - convert to 56 features - then merge with (56,56) space
