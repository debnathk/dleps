- Collect prostate cancer specific drugs - sort by popularity - Done!!!
- Calculate fingerprints - Pipeline is ready!!
- Take the training set drugs, calculate fingerprints for them as well (425 drugs)
    - Extract the SMILES for 425 drugs, load onto maple - Done!!!
- Finaly, calculate the tanimoto similarity between the drugs - Done!!!
- Additionally, calculate the tanimoto similarity between each reference drugs - Done!!!
- Merge the features to the existing model:
    1) Pass the 425x18x1 dataset to an DNN, create 56 features - merge the 18 features to the existing (56,56) space
    2) Pass the 3072 fingerprints to DNN, convert to 56 features - then merge with (56,56) space
    3) Pass the 18x3072 features to VAE - convert to 56 features - then merge with (56,56) space
- Update - IC50 dataset downloaded from GDSC can be used to extract drugs targeted against PRAD (prostate cancer cell line) and use them as reference drugs - This will increase the similarity matrix size. The steps are as follows:
    1) Filter out drugs targeted against PRAD - Done!!!
    2) Filter out drugs based on max_conc - < 10uM - Done!!!
    3) Check the availability of SMILES of those drugs in PubChem - (found 207 drugs) Done!!!
    4) Finally prepare the ssp - In Process!!
- Similarly, train the model with updated ssp data get results - by monday.
